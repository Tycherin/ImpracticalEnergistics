# Impractical Energistics

## About

Impractical Energistics is an addon mod for Applied Energistics 2 (AE2) that adds new features that extend AE2's mechanics. These features might be unique, interesting, or even powerful, but they are all impractical.

Impractical Energistics requires [Applied Energistics 2](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) to work.
